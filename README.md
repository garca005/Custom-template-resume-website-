# Custom-template-resume-website-
Hey guys this is my resume built with the anaconda prompt and Django. it is a local host for now as I don't want my public information out in the deep web, but it is set up to deploy with heroku through git csm.

1.)these files are the main files which should be imported into a new project folder created by the django package. 

2.)the HTML file is my custome template to the website i made.

3.)my actual python code consists of all the py files included, they were modified to fit my needs but most can be easyly modified as they are just baisic lists and variables.
